Bugs:

Background skills - If skill is checked, it should only be cleared if set from the background skill selection.

To-do:
	Combat:
		Add Traits Field for Weapons
	
Clean-up:
	Move dexInitiative.js to use &{template:coc-dice-roll}
	Move Skill rolls to sheet worker on click so one place to edit the roll value.
	Add 4px to Trained Skill Checkboxes on Background tabs

Wishlist:

	Stim Tracking
	Figure out how to enter everything into the spell tab and then have it available in the drop down and auto fill for Combat / Spells.
	Add totals for equipped armor (Physical / Arcane )
