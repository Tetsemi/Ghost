Bugs:

Repeating Skills don't add their skill points spent to Total Skill Points spent.

Todo:

Social Skills

	Appearance 40 and under roll w/penalty dice
	Appearance 70 and over roll w/bonus dice
	

API work later:

The limitations on the templates is either I can show both damage and extrememe OR I can show either damage or extreme damage.  

We can have either

(Current implementation)
Impale (yes) normal = damage, critical/extreme = damage and extreme damage
Impale (no)  normal = damage, critical/extreme = damage and extreme damage

OR

Impale (yes) normal = damage, critical/extreme = extreme damage
Impale (no)  normal = damage, critical/extreme = extreme damage

But NOT

Impale (yes) normal = damage, critical/extreme = damage and extreme damage
Impale (no)  normal = damage, critical/extreme = extreme damage
