BUGS:

To-do:
	
	Add data-i18n entries for all sheet-bottom sections. this will require a big rework, need to update the talentDataMap, careerDataMap, the summary update code, and the translation.json entries.
		Racial talents
		Career talents
		
		Don't use memory.
		Don't use cache.
		
		In file ghost_of_arcadia.html, review section <div class="sheet-tab-content sheet-careers"> And create a to-do list of items that display text that are missing data-i18n from the third <div class="sheet-section"> and sheet-career-tab sheet-tab-codeweaver only. This is a big one, and I don't want to miss anything, so we'll do each of the 5 sections, 1 at a time.
		
		Generate HTML and translation.json entries in separate blocks please
		
	maskwrights_grace: {
	  nameKey:  "talent_alteri_maskwrights_grace-u",
	  rulesKey: "talent_alteri_maskwrights_grace_rules-u",
      name: "Maskwrightâ€™s Grace",
      description: "Choose one: gain +10% to Disguise, Insight, or Performance (Impersonation). This choice is permanent and may only be taken once.",
	  skills: [ "disguise", "perform_impersonation", "insight" ],
      prerequisite: "",
      tier: 1,
      cost: "10",
      capstone: false,
      usage_limit: ""
    },
	
	Using file ghost_of_arcadia.html and reference talentDataMap, along with existing HTML in the sheet-talents section, provide the Lyranni i18n keys for nameKey and rulesKey for the translation.json file. Response should be alphabetical by Tier grouping. Provide all 4 tiers, pull the strings from the map and proceed, again, alphabetical by tier. Do not use ellipsis and use format talent_<race>_<talent>-u and talent_<race>_<talent>_rules-u
