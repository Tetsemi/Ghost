Bugs:

Repeating Skills don't add their skill points spent to Total Skill Points spent.

Talents and Backgrounds are always showing Alteri + chosen race


Add XP Pool single input box, XP pool available, but put in framework, like skill point above to track XP spent and XP total down the road.
Add/Change XP Total should look at XP Spent value and update XP available (read only).

Update colors
