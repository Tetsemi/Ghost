Bugs:


Clean-up:

	Move base values for skills from label to it's own field in the skills section and remove from label.
	Move dexInitiative.js to use &{template:coc-dice-roll}
	Move Skill rolls to sheet worker on click so one place to edit the roll value.

Wishlist:

	Stim Tracking
	Figure out how to enter everything into the spell tab and then have it available in the drop down and auto fill for Combat / Spells.
	Add totals for equipped armor (Physical / Arcane )
