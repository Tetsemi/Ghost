Bugs:

Repeating Skills don't add their skill points spent to Total Skill Points spent.

Social Skills

	
So to keep this simple, we use the registerStatHandler and have it look for a change in Appearance.

	Appearance 40 and under roll w/penalty dice
	Appearance 70 and over roll w/bonus dice
	
	It will set a hidden input and we'll use that input to display either the normal skill roll or a skill roll that rolls roll1=[[d100]] roll2=[[d100]]
	Need a new template based off of coc-1 that adds the roll2 check to it.
	Take a look at template:coc in the original doc as it did something similiar.
