	Secondary Career Skill Points not getting added to Ledger

To-do:

	Something that is there, but should now be hard and fast is a Healing Saturation Tracker, it should have up to five tick boxes, or just a counter that goes from 0-5, if we can look at that.  We have had it in game, but before we were using Talia's stim tracker from star wars for it.  If we can add that somehere that would be helpful.  Basically it is a dimishing return tracker for Healing.
	
	Add totals for equipped armor (Physical / Arcane )
	
	Add XP value to Racial and Career Talent headers
		
	Combat:
		Add Traits Field for Weapons
		
Clean-up:

	Clean up <span> HTML for Tracker (scene and session)
	
	Move Skill rolls to sheet worker on click so one place to edit the roll value.
