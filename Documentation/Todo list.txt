Questions:
		Combat Medic

			Is there a reason these tier 3 talents prerequisites went from OR to AND?

			Tier 3 prerequisite display corrected to AND (career_talent_and-u) for:
				quickdraw_injector (Injector Harness AND Painkiller Protocol)
				veil_immunologist (Pressure Seal AND Vital Scan Overlay)

		Tier 5

			Last Measure Injection
		
			Field Expeditor or Medical Override

			Field Expeditor is Tier 4 - Good
			Medical Override is Tier 2 - Bad

			Also, the new Triage Commander doesn't unlock anything in Tier 5, so it's a dead end.  Did you mean to have Last Measure Injection use Field Expiditor or Triage Commander?
