BUGS:	

To-do:		

		Career primary and secondary skills should be an array not a js-object of name:description
		
		Need to update helpers to use new format.
		
		function resetAllMDRToBase(race, callback)
		function initializeRaceState(race)
		const calculateAndUpdateSkillValues
		function registerSkillHandler(racePrefix, triggerSkillsArg = [], talentSources = [])
		const initNewCharacterSkills
	
		New Careers
			Investigator (need full work up, including tabs)
			Spirit Warden (need full workup, tabs done)
			
		Forgery move from Social to Tech/Cyber
		Insight move from Social to Surival
	
Clean-up:

	Move Skill rolls to sheet worker on click so one place to edit the roll value.
