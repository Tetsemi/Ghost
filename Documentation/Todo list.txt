	Something that is there, but should now be hard and fast is a Healing Saturation Tracker, it should have up to five tick boxes, or just a counter that goes from 0-5, if we can look at that.  We have had it in game, but before we were using Talia's stim tracker from star wars for it.  If we can add that somehere that would be helpful.  Basically it is a dimishing return tracker for Healing.
