Code cleanup:

    None of these listeners should fire on sheet opened. With very few exceptions, the only time sheet opened should be used is 1) if something is being done with the jquery implementation since it isn't persistent, or 2) update logic is being run.
    
	There is no "add" event in sheetworkers. The change event and repeating row "removed" event handle all attribute events.
	
	


-------------------- From Llama Start ----------------------------
To determine a character’s Speed Rating, use the following formula:

Speed = (Dexterity + Athletics%) ÷ 10 (rounded down), to a maximum of 12.

Just movement, it is a rating, that shows, who has the lead in a pursuit, or chase, it is that number +1d10 and then the highest goes first in the pursuit chase, and so, determines initiative and who is in control during those situations
-------------------- From Llama End ----------------------------

Add XP Pool single input box, XP pool available, but put in framework, like skill point above to track XP spent and XP total down the road.
Add/Change XP Total should look at XP Spent value and update XP available (read only).
