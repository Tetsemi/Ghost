Repeating Skills don't add their skill points spent to Total Skill Points spent.

------------------------- Initiative -----------------------------
Initiative
﻿
Initiative determines how fast you act when things go bad. It’s a reflex check made at the start of combat.
﻿
To determine Initiative, roll a d100 and try to roll equal to or under your Dexterity (DEX) . Your place in the turn order is based on how well you succeed. e better the success—Normal, Hard, Extreme, or Critical—the earlier you act. Ties are broken by DEX scores, and situational modifiers may apply.
﻿
I can create a separate button for this that sends the result to the tracker. 
﻿
Critical = 4000 + (dex)
Extreme = 3000 + (dex)
Hard = 2000 + (dex)
Normal = 1000 + (dex)
Fail = 0 + (dex)
Fumble = 0

-------------------------- Speed/Move ---------------------------

To determine a character’s Speed Rating, use the following formula:

Speed = (Dexterity + Athletics%) ÷ 10 (rounded down), to a maximum of 14.

Just movement, it is a rating, that shows, who has the lead in a pursuit, or chase, it is that number +1d10 and then the highest goes first in the pursuit chase, and so, determines initiative and who is in control during those situations

Need to send to tracker.

-------------------- From Llama End ----------------------------

Add XP Pool single input box, XP pool available, but put in framework, like skill point above to track XP spent and XP total down the road.
Add/Change XP Total should look at XP Spent value and update XP available (read only).
