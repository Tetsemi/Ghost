Codeweaver - Tier 5 Capstones – 30 XP (Choose One Only)
Talent	Description	Prerequisite
Overcode Detonation	Once per session, trigger a system cascade affecting any archanotech network or drone field within medium range. All affected systems must roll POW or INT or suffer shutdown, 1d6 damage, or go berserk (your choice per target). Cybernetic limbs and smart weapons tied to living users are unaffected.	Magelock Cascade or Crash Field
Signal Possession	Once per session, take full control of a drone, turret, or archanotech construct within medium range for the rest of the scene. If the target is destroyed or disconnected, you may transfer control to another valid device once.	Subroutine Leash or Command Injection
Reality Patch	Once per session, cast a Technomancy spell with a casting time of 1 action or less as a reaction to a failed defense, corrupted system, or Veil event. The spell automatically succeeds but costs double Strain.	Live Patch Redirect or Veil-Reactor Stabilizer
+5% Stat Boost	Increase any one core stat — including Magic — by +5%, up to your racial maximum. May only be taken once.	Any Tier 4 talent
