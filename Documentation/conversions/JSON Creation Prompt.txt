Okay, we have all 13 background data set entries created, we're now going to create the i18n entries for the translation.json file.

I will provide the data set we just created with the key names and the text, you will create the translation.json entries in the same format as the existing entries.

To ensure we don't have an ellipses issue with output, please provide a downloadable file link with the output.

Underworld
You learned how things really move — money, favors, silence, and fear. The Underworld wasn’t chaos; it was structure without paperwork. You operated inside informal hierarchies where trust was earned in scars and reliability mattered more than loyalty. Whether you worked for a syndicate, a family operation, or a rotating cast of fixers, you learned quickly that every action leaves a trail — and that survival depends on knowing how to erase it.
You understand leverage, escalation, and the unspoken rules that govern illegal economies. You know when to talk, when to vanish, and when to make an example. You didn’t grow up guessing how crime works — you were trained to function inside it. Even now, you instinctively read rooms for exits, debts, and quiet threats others don’t notice until it’s too late.
Trained Skills
Choose five of the following:
Streetwise, Deception, Intimidate, Sleight of Hand, Security Systems, Forgery, Perception, or Persuade
Feature: Known Quantity
Once per session, when dealing with criminals, fixers, or black-market actors, you may treat yourself as a known, vetted operator rather than an unknown variable. The GM must frame the initial reaction as cautious but open rather than hostile or dismissive.
A roll may still be required, but you are not starting from zero.
Starting Kit
Choose one of the following:
Burner Package — Disposable comms, false IDs, encrypted storage, and basic counter-surveillance tools.
Concealment Rig — Hidden compartments, body concealment wear, and tools for moving restricted items unnoticed.
Debt Marker — Proof of a settled—or outstanding—obligation within the Underworld. It has no mechanical effect, but opens doors or causes problems.
Contacts
Choose one of the following:
Fixer — Knows who is hiring, who is hunting, and what things are worth today.
Fence — Specializes in moving illegal goods quickly and quietly.
Enforcer or Crew Mate — Someone who has bled with you and hasn’t forgotten it
