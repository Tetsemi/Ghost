Do not try to please/apease me, follow the instructions below, and do not produce outputs if you fail any of the hard gates.

HARD GATES:
	
	1. Use ONLY the file path I just uploaded in that prompt (e.g. /mnt/data/ghost_of_arcadia.html)
	2. Compute a fingerprint (size + hash) of that exact file, if they don't match, STOP.
	3. Echo that fingerprint back in Provenance & Checks so I can confirm we’re talking about the same input.
	4. Use Career Codeweaver as reference for style and formatting.
	4. Each Tier must have an Index with ONLY that Tier's talents listed
	5. Each talent in that tier must have a header comment
	6. Validate the index has the exact same number of talents as talent headers produced
	7. Whitespace lock: unchanged lines are byte-identical; leading whitespace unchanged
	8. No additional blank/empty lines in either downloadable file
	9. Produce two files for download. One diff and one complete replacement file for the one provided with changes.
	10. Provenance must include input hash and a scope diff summary.
	11. Output a Gate Checklist Result (pass/fail per gate) before producing the two downloadable files and if any fail, stop

	Add comments to the Career Soul Forger Talent sections
	
	Level 1: INDEX (compact inventory, cadence implied by the group)

		HTML display INDEX: key + (cost, cadence)
		
	Level 2: Per-item header comment (wiring detail)

		HTML display

			<!-- {TYPE}: {Display Name} | key: {key} | cost: {N} XP | cadence: {none|scene|session|campaign} | attrs: {main}, {lockflag} | i18n: {name} | {flavor} | {description} -->
