Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this section.

For the creation of content use careerDataMap.combat_medic as your template/reference.  All necessary objects are there for reference

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Career key: careerDataMap.veil_dancer

Section: talents.tier === 5, capstone === true

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMap objects, Career HTML, Tracker HTML, use existing style in files provided

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS), use existing style in files provided.

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON), use existing style in files provided.

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Higher tiers intentionally ignored and may be temporarily broken until migrated

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., name_key, rule_text-Key, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, type, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Career + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:

Veil Dancer – Tier 5 Talents (30 XP)
Talent	Description	Prerequisite

Falling Star Impact	Type: Action (Impact Descent) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Move up to two range bands in a straight line toward a point you can see, ignoring difficult terrain and vertical distance. When you land, all enemies within Engaged range must oppose your Magic (Alteration) with STR or DEX. Each creature you defeat takes 2d6 Arcane damage, is knocked Prone, and becomes Impaired until the end of its next turn. You remain standing at the center of the impact.	Borrowed Horizon
Heaven-Shattering Sequence	Type: Action (Perfect Assault) • Cost: 2d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Declare a sequence of flawless motion against a single target within Short range. Make up to three melee or unarmed attacks against that target as part of this Action. Each attack is rolled separately and resolves normally. The target may Dodge or Fight Back only once during this sequence; all subsequent attacks bypass Reactions. After the sequence resolves, you may immediately reposition to any space within Short range of the target without provoking Reactions.	Veilbreaker Palm
Stillness Between Heartbeats	Type: Reaction (Temporal Interdiction) • Cost: 1d8 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Trigger: A visible creature within Short range begins an Action. Effect: Roll Magic (Alteration) opposed by the creature’s DEX (or relevant casting skill, if a spell). On a success, the triggering action is suspended. You immediately take a full turn (Action, Maneuver, Free Actions) outside Initiative. When your turn ends, the suspended action resolves with 1 penalty die. Whether you succeed or fail, you cannot take Reactions until the start of your next turn.	The World Says No
The Veil Will Not Let You Fall	Type: Action (Existential Assertion) • Cost: 1d8 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Until the end of the Scene, the first time you would be reduced to 0 HP or removed from play by forced movement, that effect is negated. You instead reposition to any space within Short range and remain at 1 HP. This effect then ends. The Strain cost is applied immediately when this talent is activated.	Unbound Dance
Zero-Point Mastery	Type: Action (Mythic State) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Until the end of the Scene, you partially sever your relationship with mass and inertia. Each round, you may take one additional Maneuver without paying Strain, and your movement between range bands never provokes Reactions. While this state is active, you cannot be Slowed, Hobbled, knocked Prone, or forcibly repositioned by effects that do not explicitly ignore stabilization. When the Scene ends, you become Exhausted until you recover at least 1 Strain.	Impossible Footing
