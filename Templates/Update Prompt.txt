Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this section.

For the creation of content use careerDataMap.combat_medic as your template/reference.  All necessary objects are there for reference

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Career key: careerDataMap.combat_engineer

Section: talents.<talent name>.tier === 5, capstone === true

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMap objects, Career HTML, Tracker HTML, use existing style in files provided

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS), use existing style in files provided.

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON), use existing style in files provided.

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Higher tiers intentionally ignored and may be temporarily broken until migrated

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., name_key, rule_text-Key, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, type, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Career + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:

Combat Engineer – Tier 5 Capstones (30 XP) — Choose One
Talent	Description	Prerequisite

Catastrophe Buffer	Type: Reaction (Mitigation) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Trigger: A Mapped structure, vehicle, drone, turret, or piece of equipment within Medium would be destroyed, collapse, or suffer a major malfunction. Effect: You reroute power, brace load, or shed systems at the last possible moment. Reduce all damage, collapse effects, or malfunction severity caused by the triggering event by half (rounded down). Any remaining catastrophic outcome becomes a delayed hazard that triggers at the end of the next round instead of immediately.	Failsafe Architect
Failsafe Codex	Type: Reaction (Restore) • Cost: 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Instantly restore a damaged system you have interacted with to up to one-third of its maximum HP, and it gains advantage on checks to resist malfunctions for the remainder of the scene.	Failsafe Architect
Field Constructor	Type: Action (Deployable) • Cost: 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Rapidly construct one: (1) Turret (2d6 damage, 3 rounds), (2) Barricade (+2 Armor & cover), or (3) Utility drone. Requires Mechanics. Breaks down at scene end.	Auto-Repair Subroutines or Power Splice
Master of Collapse	Type: Action (Networked Triggers) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Trigger all sabotage points you’ve placed in a structure. On success, all collapse zones deal 3d6 damage; targets must Dodge or become trapped.	Collapse Engineer
System Subjugation	Type: Action (Area Seize) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Attempt to seize all devices in a small area: Opposed Electronics vs. System Integrity (SI). On Hard Success, control lasts the scene. This talent can target Hardened systems.	Hijack Protocol
