Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. 

I will upload and you will only reference:

	ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)
	ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)
	translation.json (i18n)

I will paste the updated text for the section.

Task: Update ONLY the following section, do not look ahead at other sections, only the current one:

	Career key: careerDataMap.shadowblade
	Section: talents.<talent name>.tier === 4

Reference: Use combat_medic only as the data-object schema reference. For HTML/CSS structure and classes, copy the existing pattern in ghost_of_arcadia.html/css for the targeted career/tier.

HTML 
	This is the start of the HTML career block - <div class="sheet-career-tab sheet-tab-<career>">
	This is the start of the HTML Tracker block - <div class="sheet-tracker-section sheet-tracker-talent">
	The careerDataMap is in the <script type="text/worker">

CSS

    Will look like .ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet input[name="attr_show_<career>_<talent>"][value="1"] ~ .sheet-<career>-<talent>,

JSON 

	JSON is alphaebtical by pairs only, call out any line being worked on that has more than one pair or is in any way malformed

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

	HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMap objects, Career HTML, Tracker HTML, use existing style in files provided, in alphabetical order
	CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS), use existing style in files provided, provide as one complete ADD / REMOVE block.
	JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON), use existing style in files provided, provide ADD / REMOVE block in alphabetical order

Hard rules:

	Line-Structure Lock
		ADD blocks must have the same number of lines as their corresponding REMOVE block unless the Inputs force an insertion/deletion.
		When insertions/deletions are required, they must reuse the existing indentation style from adjacent lines.

	REMOVE blocks must be copied verbatim from the current file text (including comment headers and braces); ADD blocks are the same block with minimal edits.

	Alphabetize by talent key (snake_case) for data/i18n/tracker/CSS selectors (not by label text).
	Talent key is derived from the talent name: lowercase, remove punctuation, spaces → underscores

	Use the files provided in the prompt, do not proceed if files are not provided. 
	Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

	Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only
	When a talent is removed from the tier’s HTML/data, REMOVE its tracker hooks, CSS show selectors, and translation keys in the same patch even if other tiers still reference them.
	Removed means removed from ALL three surfaces: careerDataMap entry, Career HTML row, and Tracker HTML/CSS hooks and translation keys

	Patch Scope Lock: Only include the smallest contiguous block(s) that materially change. Do not include unchanged wrapper containers (tier wrappers, toolbars, controller blocks) if no lines inside them change.

	Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.
	In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

	Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).
	Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

	i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields
	Career talent i18n keys must use: career_<career>_<talent>-u and career_<career>_<talent>_rules-u

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

	Update/create the data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., name_key, rule_text-Key, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.
	Talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, type, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.
	Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

	Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.
	Career + section targeted.
	Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

	JSON validity (parseable)
	No duplicate i18n keys created
	All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)
	HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet
	CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)
	Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

	Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.
	Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).
	Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.
	Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
	If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.
	If there are no changes, produce a no-op, don't just put an add / remove with the same data

Corrections:

	Pistol is replaced by Handgun
	pistol is replaced by handgun
	Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
	archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:
The pasted Inputs are authoritative; update the sheet to match them even if the current files differ.
