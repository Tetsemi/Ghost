Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Ancestry talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Ancestry key: ancestryTalentDataMap.alteri

Section: talents.<talent name>.tier === 1

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMapObject, Ancestry HTML, Tracker HTML

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON).

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Ancestry data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Ancestry + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:

Alteri – Tier 1 Talents (10 XP)
Talent Description

Behavioral Study Type: Action (Observation) • Cost: — • Usage: At-will — After a brief interaction or focused observation of a specific individual, you may attempt to prepare a Mask based on them. Make an Insight roll. On a Success, you may finalize the Mask without requiring a full scene of observation. If the subject is alert, guarded, or trained to resist scrutiny, this roll is opposed by their Willpower. On a Failure, a full scene of observation is still required.
Disciplined Morphology Type: Passive (Physiology) • Cost: — • Usage: Permanent — rough practice and internal control, you can extend your morphic limits beyond standard Alteri capability. When assuming a Mask, you may convincingly impersonate humanoid targets that are significantly larger or smaller than your natural form by altering tissue density, posture, and internal structure. is expands your plausible appearance range beyond your base size but does not change your Size stat, reach, damage, encumbrance, or physical capabilities.
Plausible Existence Type: Passive (Assumption) • Cost: — • Usage: At-will — While acting within the expected role, behavior, and social position of your current Mask, neutral observers and non-alert systems treat your presence as legitimate by default unless they possess a concrete reason to doubt you. is does not override active investigations, formal verification, direct contradictions, or known hostile intelligence.
Second Skin Type: Passive (Identity) • Cost: — • Usage: At-will — You may maintain one additional Mask beyond your default identity. Switching Masks requires an Action and costs 1d4 Strain when performed during an active scene or situation. Outside of an active scene, switching Masks does not cost Strain.
Social Attunement Type: Free Action (Assessment) • Cost: — • Usage: 1/Scene — Choose a character you are directly interacting with and make an Insight roll. On a Success, you learn the general social expectations they have of you in the interaction, such as authority, familiarity, distance, or formality. On a Hard Success, you also learn one behavioral adjustment that would improve alignment with those expectations.
