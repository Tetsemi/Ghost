Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. 

I will upload and you will only reference:

	ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)
	ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)
	translation.json (i18n)

I will paste the updated text for the section.

Task: Update ONLY the following section, do not look ahead at other sections, only the current one:

	Career key: careerDataMap.slicer
	Section: talents.<talent name>.tier === 5, capstone === true

Reference: Use combat_engineer only as the data-object schema reference. For HTML/CSS structure and classes, copy the existing pattern in ghost_of_arcadia.html/css for the targeted career/tier.

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

	HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMap objects, Career HTML, Tracker HTML, use existing style in files provided, in alphabetical order
	CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS), use existing style in files provided, provide as one complete ADD / REMOVE block.
	JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON), use existing style in files provided, provide ADD / REMOVE block in alphabetical order

Hard rules:

	REMOVE blocks must be copied verbatim from the current file text (including comment headers and braces); ADD blocks are the same block with minimal edits.
	If the REMOVE block cannot be copied verbatim from the file, stop.
	
	Alphabetize by talent key (snake_case) for data/i18n/tracker/CSS selectors (not by label text).
	Talent key is derived from the talent name: lowercase, remove punctuation, spaces → underscores

	Use the files provided in the prompt, do not proceed if files are not provided. 
	Use the indentation and formatting in existing files
	No line may change leading whitespace unless that line’s content changes.
	
	Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only
	When a talent is removed from the tier’s HTML/data, REMOVE its tracker hooks, CSS show selectors, and translation keys in the same patch even if other tiers still reference them.
	Removed means removed from ALL three surfaces: careerDataMap entry, Career HTML row, and Tracker HTML/CSS hooks and translation keys

	Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.
	In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

	Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).
	Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

	i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields
	Career talent i18n keys must use: career_<career>_<talent>-u and career_<career>_<talent>_rules-u

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

	Update/create the data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., name_key, rule_text-Key, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.
	Talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, type, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.
	Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

	Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.
	Career + section targeted.
	Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

	JSON validity (parseable)
	No duplicate i18n keys created
	All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)
	HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet
	CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)
	Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

	Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.
	Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).
	Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.
	Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
	If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.
	If there are no changes, produce a no-op, don't just put an add / remove with the same data

Corrections:

	Pistol is replaced by Handgun
	pistol is replaced by handgun
	Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
	archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:
The pasted Inputs are authoritative; update the sheet to match them even if the current files differ.

Slicer – Tier 5 Capstones (30 XP) — Choose One
Talent	Description	Prerequisite

Dead Man’s Switch	Type: Reaction (Contingency) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Trigger: You are forcibly disconnected or suffer Catastrophic Resolution during an intrusion. Effect: Immediately trigger one prepared system-level effect affecting the system you were connected to (such as purging selected logs, hard-locking access points, wiping a specific dataset, or disabling a defined subsystem). This effect resolves even though the intrusion ends and represents pre-seeded logic rather than continued access. This does not prevent consequences to you.	Black Trace Nullifier
Digital Ghost State	Type: Free Action (Ghost Mode) • Cost: 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Activate while connected to a network. For the next two rounds, your interactions do not generate active alerts and cannot be upgraded beyond silent alerts. You may not initiate latent intrusions or issue disruptive commands during this state. Escalation and System Overrun proceed normally. When this effect ends, you must immediately abort the intrusion or suffer one automatic Overrun consequence.	Pulse Cloak Shell or Silent Loop
Failsafe Override Core	Type: Reaction (Last Action) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Trigger: You would be forcibly disconnected or suffer Catastrophic Resolution. Effect: You remain connected long enough to take one final Action or Maneuver before the intrusion ends. This action resolves normally but cannot generate new Reactions or prevent the disconnection. Any consequences already triggered still apply.	Deck Hardening Suite
Root Authority Rewrite	Type: Action (Control Rewrite) • Cost: 1d8 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — While actively connected to a network, you seize temporary root authority over one system domain. For the remainder of the scene or until you disconnect, you may issue one system-level command per round without increasing its time cost (such as sealing access, grounding drones, suppressing alarms, or rewriting logs). This authority does not prevent escalation or System Overrun and ends immediately if Catastrophic Resolution occurs. Hardened systems may resist individual commands at the GM’s discretion.	Expanded Node Logic
Total Signal Collapse	Type: Action (Network Shutdown) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — While actively connected to a network, you forcibly collapse its active response state. Until the end of the current round, escalation does not advance, all automated defenses and counter-intrusion logic are suppressed, and no new alerts are generated. Existing alerts and consequences are not undone. At the end of the round, the intrusion ends immediately and the system enters full alert status. This does not prevent narrative fallout.
