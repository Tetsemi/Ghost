Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for:

Career key: mindbender

Section: Tier 5 Capstone

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML).

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet containing only the new/changed translation.json entries required by this section.

Hard rules:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions).

i18n: add only missing keys; do not delete or rename existing keys unless I explicitly instruct you to.

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Career + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
Archanotech is Arcanotech

Inputs:

Mindbender – Tier 5 Capstones (30 XP) — Choose One
Talent	Description	Prerequisite
The Inevitable Choice	Type: Action (Dominate) • Cost: 2d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Choose one creature within Short and roll Magic (Enchantment) opposed by the target’s POW. On a success, you take direct control of the target until the end of its next turn, choosing its movement, Action, and Maneuvers as if it were acting willingly. You may not force the use of once-per-session abilities, consumables, or self-destructive actions. When control ends, the target is fully aware its will was overridden. After this effect ends, you cannot use Enchantment spells or Mindbender talents that influence thoughts or emotions until the end of your next turn, and you suffer 1 penalty die on all social rolls for the remainder of the scene.	Commitment Trap
Perfect Foreknowledge	Type: Action (Imprint Belief) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Choose one creature within Short and roll Magic (Enchantment) opposed by the target’s POW.
Effect: On a success, you implant a single plausible belief about the current situation. Until the end of the scene, the target treats this belief as true when making decisions, rationalizing contradictory information rather than rejecting it outright. This belief does not override direct sensory evidence, compel specific actions, or alter identity or loyalties.	Resonant Authority
Unassailable Mind	Type: Reaction • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Trigger: You are targeted by a social effect, Enchantment spell, interrogation, intimidation, or any attempt to influence, read, or destabilize your mental or emotional state.
Effect: The triggering effect automatically fails. Until the end of the scene, hostile creatures cannot gain actionable insight into your thoughts, emotions, intentions, or leverage through social skills or mind-affecting effects. Attempts may still occur, but they provide no mechanical or narrative advantage.	Psychological Blind Spot
Dominant Impulse	Type: Action (Mass Compulsion) • Cost: 2d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Choose one simple directive (such as fight, flee, hold position, pursue, or protect a specific target) and any number of hostile creatures within Medium that can see or hear you. Each target rolls POW to resist. On a failure, the creature is compelled to pursue the directive for the remainder of the scene. At the start of each affected creature’s turn, it may attempt to resist again with a POW roll; on a success, the compulsion ends for that creature. The creature retains control of its Actions and may act intelligently, but will not willingly act against the directive while affected.	Resonant Authority
Fractured Reality	Type: Action (Mind Break) • Cost: 2d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Choose one creature within Short that can see or hear you and roll Magic (Enchantment) opposed by the target’s POW. On a success, until the end of the scene, the target suffers 1 penalty die on all Actions, cannot benefit from cover, elevation, or similar positional advantages, and the first time each round it attempts to take a Reaction, it must succeed on a POW roll or lose that Reaction. On a failure, these effects instead last until the end of the target’s next turn. The target remains aware but cannot reliably distinguish reality from hallucination.	Leverage Point
