Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Career key: hexbreaker	

Section: Tier 4 Capstone Talents

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML).

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON).

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions).

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Career + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:

Hexbreaker – Tier 4 Capstones (40 XP each) – Choose One
Talent	Description	Prerequisite
Final Rend	Type: Action (Execution) • Cost: 1d6 + 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — You must be Engaged with an opponent you have already hit this Scene using your Bound Focus. Make a single melee attack with your Bound Focus against that opponent. On a hit, the attack deals arcane damage and gains +2d6 damage. Damage is reduced only by the opponent’s arcane damage reduction. If this attack reduces the opponent to half HP or lower, they are Staggered until the end of their next turn. After resolving this attack, you lose all Reactions and suffer 1 penalty die on all defenses until the start of your next turn. This attack cannot benefit from other Hex or Rider effects.	Shatter the Seal
Edge of Attrition	Type: Action (Stance) • Cost: 1d6 Strain to enter; 1 Strain per Round to maintain • Usage: 1/Session — You enter a duelist’s stance against an opponent you are Engaged with. Choose one opponent you are Engaged with; the stance lasts while you remain Engaged with that opponent and continue to pay the upkeep cost. While active: (1) You gain +10% on all Fight Back reactions against the chosen opponent. (2) The chosen opponent suffers –10% to all melee or unarmed attacks against targets other than you. (3) The first time each Round you and the chosen opponent both succeed on opposed melee checks against each other, your success tier is treated as one step higher. This stance does not stack with other stance-based, zone-based, or threat-enforcing effects. The stance ends immediately if you disengage, lose Engaged status, fail to pay upkeep, or choose a new target. When the stance ends, you are Impaired until the start of your next turn.	Claim the Exchange
Break the Pattern	Type: Action (Disruption) • Cost: 1d6 + 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — You slam your Bound Focus into the flow of the fight, fracturing timing and coordination. Choose one opponent you are Engaged with. Until the end of the current Round, all hostile opponents within Short range of that opponent suffer the following effects: they cannot benefit from Assist actions; they suffer 1 penalty die on the first Reaction they attempt this Round; and any opponent that moves, disengages, or changes targets during this Round suffers –10% to their next roll before the end of their next turn. After this effect ends, you are Shaken until the start of your next turn.	Faultline Strike
Stand the Line	Type: Action (Stance) • Cost: 1d6 Strain to enter; 1 Strain per Round to maintain • Usage: 1/Session — You plant yourself and dare the fight to break on you. Until the stance ends, you project a Short-radius threat zone centered on you. While active: (1) Hostile opponents within the zone suffer –10% to all attacks against targets other than you. (2) The first time each Round an opponent within the zone attacks a target other than you, you may immediately take a Free Action to move one range band toward that opponent (ending Engaged if applicable). (3) The first time each Round you are hit by an attack while this stance is active, reduce the damage by 1d6 (after DR). This stance does not stack with other stance-based, zone-based, or threat-enforcing effects. The stance ends immediately if you are moved unwillingly, become Incapacitated, or fail to pay the upkeep cost. When the stance ends, you are Shaken until the start of your next turn.

Oath of the Breach	Type: Action (Vow) • Cost: 1d6 + 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Choose one opponent you can see and name them as your breach. Until the end of the Scene, while you and the chosen opponent are within Medium range of each other, the following effects apply: (1) The first time each Round the chosen opponent attacks, disengages, or targets someone other than you, they immediately become Shaken. (2) The first time each Round you hit the chosen opponent with a melee attack using your Bound Focus, you may either clear Shaken from yourself or gain +10% on your next melee or Fight Back roll against that opponent before the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you become Incapacitated, voluntarily retreat beyond Medium range, or choose to end the vow as a Free Action.	Marked by Contact
