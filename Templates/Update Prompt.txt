Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Ancestry talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Ancestry key: ancestryTalentDataMap.alteri

Section: talents.<talent name>.tier === 4, capstone === true

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMapObject, Ancestry HTML, Tracker HTML

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON).

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Ancestry data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Ancestry + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:

Alteri – Tier 4 Capstones (40 XP) — Choose One
Talent Description Prerequisite
Author of the Moment Type: Special Immediate (Narrative Control) • Cost: 2 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — During a sustained social interaction, declare one reasonable assumption about your role, presence, or relationship to the situation that has not yet been contradicted. For the remainder of the scene, neutral observers treat that assumption as true unless actively challenged or disproven. You gain +1 bonus die on the first roll made to act in accordance with that assumption. Predictive Empathy
Immaculate Impersonation Type: Passive (Identity Authority) • Cost: — • Usage: 1/Session — When you activate a prepared Mask of a specific individual, neutral and friendly observers and non-hostile systems accept you as the legitimate individual for the duration of the scene unless presented with direct, compelling contradiction or incontrovertible proof. You gain +1 bonus die on Performance (Impersonation), Deception, and Etiquette rolls made to sustain this identity. is does not override prior personal familiarity or systems designed to verify genetic identity. Hardened Biometric Assimilation
Living Mask Archive Type: Passive (Identity Capacity) • Cost: — • Usage: At-will / 1/Session — You may maintain up to four prepared Masks simultaneously. Outside of active scenes, you may switch freely between prepared Masks without cost. Once per session, you may switch to any prepared Mask during a scene without spending an Action or Strain, provided the transition is plausibly supported by the environment or social context. Identity Saturation
Perfect Adaptation Type: Passive (Behavioral Mastery) • Cost: — • Usage: 1/Session — When you enter a scene under a prepared Mask, choose one social domain relevant to that identity, such as authority, familiarity, subservience, professionalism, or anonymity. For the rest of the scene, you are treated as naturally fluent in that domain. Once during the scene, you may treat one failed Performance (Impersonation), Deception, Persuade, or Etiquette roll tied to that domain as a Success instead of a Failure. Seamless Transition
Social Null Field Type: Passive (Cognitive Absence) • Cost: — • Usage: 1/Session — For the duration of a scene, your presence does not anchor attention or memory unless you take decisive or disruptive action. Casual observers struggle to recall your appearance, voice, or specific involvement once focus moves elsewhere. is does not affect targeted surveillance, active tracking, or characters already focused on you. Social Blind Spot
