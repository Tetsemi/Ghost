Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Career key: sigilbound				

Section: Tier 5 Capstone

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML).

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet containing only the new/changed translation.json entries required by this section.

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions).

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Career + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech
