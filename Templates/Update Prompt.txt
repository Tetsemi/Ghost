Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Ancestry talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Ancestry key: alteri

Section: traits

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMapObject, Ancestry HTML, Tracker HTML

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON).

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Ancestry data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Ancestry + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

In JSON replace "Rules:" with "\n\n"
In JSON replace "Once per" with "\n\n"
Ensure there are not occurrences where you have double entries, only one set of "\n\n" should be between lines.

Inputs:

Ancestry Features: Alteri
Shifting Form Alteri possess a mutable physiology that allows them to physically reshape their body and voice to resemble another humanoid of similar size and structure. This transformation is biological rather than illusory: flesh alters, bone shifts, and vocal structure reconfigures. To most observers, an Alteri does not appear disguised—they appear real. Rules: You may physically assume the appearance and voice of any broadly humanoid ancestry or individual of comparable size. This does not alter your statistics, equipment, cyberware, credentials, or social authority, and does not grant knowledge or access you do not possess. Shifting Form is governed by detailed rules covering timing, Strain costs, scrutiny, and identity management; see Appendix: Alteri Masks & Shifting.
True Morphology Alteri transformations have mass, texture, breath, and physical presence consistent with what they appear to be. Their altered form exists fully in the physical world rather than as a projected or arcane overlay. Rules: Your transformed form is not an illusion and cannot be dismissed, dispelled, or negated by effects that suppress or invalidate illusion magic. This does not protect you from physical inspection, biometric analysis, or magic designed to analyze altered bodies rather than illusions. This feature establishes plausibility under scrutiny; it does not confer immunity.
Social Calibration Alteri are trained to sense when their presence, behavior, or presentation does not align with the social rhythm of a space. Through subconscious attention to posture, timing, tone, and reaction, they recognize instability before it becomes overt conflict. Rules: When you enter a sustained social interaction where your current identity, behavior, or presentation would plausibly create suspicion or instability, the GM must warn you before consequences escalate. This warning provides no mechanical benefit, reveals no intentions or solutions, and does not prevent consequences if you continue. It exists to prevent accidental escalation, not deliberate risk.
Fixed Tell No Alteri transformation is flawless. Each Alteri possesses a Fixed Tell: a subtle, immutable detail that persists across all forms. This may be a recurring vocal resonance, an unnatural stillness of the eyes, a faint but consistent scent, or another small inconsistency that resists change. Rules: You must define one Fixed Tell at character creation. This detail persists across all forms and cannot be removed or concealed by any means. In situations where a character deliberately scrutinizes you, suspects deception, or possesses relevant knowledge, the GM may grant a bonus die on checks made to identify you beneath a disguise. This feature never causes automatic discovery, but it always provides a plausible avenue for exposure.
