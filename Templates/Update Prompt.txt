Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Ancestry talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Ancestry key: ancestryTalentDataMap.human

Section: <talent name>.tier === 4, capstone === true

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMapObject, Ancestry HTML, Tracker HTML

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON).

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Higher tiers intentionally ignored and may be temporarily broken until migrated

Ancestry data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Ancestry + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Humans - Tier 4 Capstones (40 XP) - Choose One
Talent Description Prerequisite

If This Works, We Win Type: Action (All-In Commitment) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Choose one clearly defined objective that would decisively end or turn the scene if completed. Until the end of the scene, all of your actions must directly advance that objective . While doing so, you gain +1 bonus die on skill rolls made toward it. This bonus applies only once per round. If the objective is completed, the scene immediately resolves or shifts in your favor. If you fail or abandon the objective, consequences escalate sharply and immediately. It Only Has to Work Once
I’ll Take the Hit Type: Reaction (Deliberate Sacrifice) • Cost: 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — When an ally within Short range would suffer damage or a condition that would remove them from meaningful participation in the scene, you may take that damage or condition instead. All effects apply to you exactly as if you were the original target. This transfer cannot be reduced, redirected, delayed, or avoided. If the effect would incapacitate you, it does so. Hold It Together
I’ve Been in Worse Type: Reaction (Refusal to Fall) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — When you would suffer a Major Wound , become Exhausted, or gain a condition that would remove you from action , you may ignore that effect until the end of the scene. You may act normally, but you cannot recover Strain, remove conditions, or benefit from effects that reduce damage or mitigate harm. When the scene ends, all ignored effects apply immediately and in full. Inside the Blast Radius
Never Tell Me the Odds Type: Special (Defiant Resolution) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — When you attempt a single skill-based action whose success would decisively alter the scene, you do not roll to determine success . The action automatically succeeds . Immediately after, roll the appropriate skill to determine the severity of consequences caused by forcing the outcome. On a Success , the consequences are minor and contained . On a Failure, the consequences are serious and disruptive. On a Fumble , the consequences are catastrophic and lasting . This roll cannot be pushed, assisted, or modified, and this talent cannot be used for attacks. Too Late to Stop Me
Someone Has to Do It Type: Action (Assumed Burden) • Cost: 2d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — When you attempt a task that is necessary to resolve the scene and failure would impose consequences on multiple allies, civilians, or the wider situation , you may declare this talent before rolling. Resolve the attempt normally. If the roll fails, you alone suffer all narrative, social, positional, or situational consequences that would have affected others. Secondary effects that are unavoidable still occur. This talent does not guarantee success or safety; it allows the scene to continue by placing the cost entirely on you. I’ve Run Worse Odds
