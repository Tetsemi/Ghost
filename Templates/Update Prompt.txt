Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. 

I will upload and you will only reference:

	ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)
	ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)
	translation.json (i18n)

I will paste the updated text for the section.

Task: Update ONLY the following section, do not look ahead at other sections, only the current one:

	Career key: careerDataMap.operator
	Section: talents.<talent name>.tier === 5, capstone === true

Reference: Use combat_medic only as the data-object schema reference. For HTML/CSS structure and classes, copy the existing pattern in ghost_of_arcadia.html/css for the targeted career/tier.


What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

	HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMap objects, Career HTML, Tracker HTML, use existing style in files provided, in alphabetical order
	CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS), use existing style in files provided, provide as one complete ADD / REMOVE block.
	JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON), use existing style in files provided, provide ADD / REMOVE block in alphabetical order

Hard rules:

	REMOVE blocks must be copied verbatim from the current file text (including comment headers and braces); ADD blocks are the same block with minimal edits.

	Alphabetize by talent key (snake_case) for data/i18n/tracker/CSS selectors (not by label text).
	Talent key is derived from the talent name: lowercase, remove punctuation, spaces → underscores

	Use the files provided in the prompt, do not proceed if files are not provided. 
	Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

	Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only
	When a talent is removed from the tier’s HTML/data, REMOVE its tracker hooks, CSS show selectors, and translation keys in the same patch even if other tiers still reference them.
	Removed means removed from ALL three surfaces: careerDataMap entry, Career HTML row, and Tracker HTML/CSS hooks and translation keys

	Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.
	In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

	Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).
	Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

	i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields
	Career talent i18n keys must use: career_<career>_<talent>-u and career_<career>_<talent>_rules-u

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

	Update/create the data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., name_key, rule_text-Key, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.
	Talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, type, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.
	Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

	Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.
	Career + section targeted.
	Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

	JSON validity (parseable)
	No duplicate i18n keys created
	All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)
	HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet
	CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)
	Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

	Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.
	Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).
	Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.
	Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
	If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.
	If there are no changes, produce a no-op, don't just put an add / remove with the same data

Corrections:

	Pistol is replaced by Handgun
	pistol is replaced by handgun
	Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
	archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:
The pasted Inputs are authoritative; update the sheet to match them even if the current files differ.

Operator – Tier 5 Capstones (30 XP) — Choose One
Talent	Description	Prerequisite

Hard Exit Protocol	Type: Reaction (Extraction) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Trigger: A hostile scene turns against the crew (an ally is incapacitated, the team becomes pinned, or an escape route is about to be cut off). You immediately designate yourself and up to three allies within Medium range. Each designated character may take one Move Maneuver as a Free Action. This movement does not trigger Reactions, Suppression shots, or attacks of opportunity, and may be used to break Line of Sight, reach Cover, or disengage from enemies. These Maneuvers must be resolved immediately or the opportunity is lost. Grim Resolve Or Tactical Apex
Last Man Doctrine	Type: Reaction (Refusal) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — When you would be incapacitated or reduced to 0 HP, you remain active until the end of your next turn. During this window, you ignore wound penalties, Suppression, and Malfunction effects. You may act normally, but you cannot regain HP during this duration.	Grim Resolve
Shatterpoint Protocol	Type: Special immediate (Damage Optimization) • Cost: 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — After you hit with a Semi-Auto or Burst Fire attack, roll damage twice and choose which result to apply. That attack also gains Armor Piercing 2.	Precision Reacquired or Combat Presence
Tactical Lock-In	Type: Free Action (Designation) • Cost: 1d4 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — After you hit a target with a ranged attack, designate that enemy. For the next two rounds, your first attack each round against that target gains +1 bonus die, and that target suffers 1 penalty die on attacks made against you.	Kinetic Retaliation or Combat Presence
Zeroed Vector Killbox	Type: Action (Mark) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Choose one visible enemy within Medium range. Until the end of the round, you and all allies gain +1 bonus die on ranged attacks against that target. If you are the first to hit the target during this window, your attack deals +2 damage.	Tactical Apex
