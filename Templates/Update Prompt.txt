Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for:

Career key: combat_medic

Section: Tier 5 Capstone

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML).

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet containing only the new/changed translation.json entries required by this section.

Hard rules:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions).

i18n: add only missing keys; do not delete or rename existing keys unless I explicitly instruct you to.

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Career + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
Archanotech is Arcanotech

Inputs:

Combat Medic – Tier 5 Capstone (30 XP) — Choose One
Talent	Description	Prerequisite
No One Dies Today	Type: Reaction (Last Stand) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Trigger: An ally within Medium would be reduced to 0 HP. Effect: Immediately attempt Medicine. On a success, the target is reduced to 0 HP but does not suffer death checks, Major Wound effects, or loss of consciousness until the end of the round and may act normally. All consequences resolve afterward unless the target is healed or stabilized.	Emergency Triage Net
Miracle Protocol	Type: Action (Critical Care) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Attempt Medicine on an ally within Engaged. On a success, restore HP equal to the maximum possible result of the Medicine roll. You may also remove one minor condition, one toxin, or one step of Veil Corruption. Major Wounds are not removed. Healing limits apply.	Field Expeditor or Ghost of the ER
Adrenal Shield Matrix	Type: Free Action (Combat Stim) • Cost: 1d4 Strain• Usage: 1/Session — When you successfully restore HP with First Aid or Medicine, grant the target 1d6 temporary HP until the end of the scene. Temporary HP does not stack and does not count as healing for Healing Saturation.	Endurance Conditioning
Last Measure Injection	Type: Action (Extreme Intervention) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Attempt Medicine on an unconscious or dying ally within Engaged. On a success, restore HP equal to twice the normal Medicine result and the target immediately gains +2 Healing Saturation. On a failure, the attempt has no effect but still counts toward Healing Saturation limits.	Field Expeditor or Medical Override
Golden Hour Doctrine	Type: Free Action (Protocol) • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Declare at the start of your first turn in a hostile scene. Until the end of the scene, the first successful First Aid or Medicine check you make does not increase Healing Saturation and ignores the daily instant-healing cap for that one instance only. All other limits apply normally.	Combat Revive
