Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Ancestry talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Ancestry key: ancestryTalentDataMap.draevi

Section: talents.<talent name>.tier === 1

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMapObject, Ancestry HTML, Tracker HTML

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON).

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Ancestry data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Ancestry + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:

Draevi — Tier 1 Talents (10 XP)
Talent Description

Endure the Long Walk Type: Special Immediate (Deferred Strain) • Cost: — • Usage: 1/Session — When you would gain Strain, fatigue, or an environmental condition due to exposure, deprivation, weather, or sustained exertion, you may delay that effect until the end of the current scene. The effect is not negated and applies in full once the scene ends.
Marks of the Road Type: Passive (Lived Memory) • Cost: — • Usage: Permanent — Choose one skill: Survival, Track, or Spirit Lore. When recalling routes, camps, hazards, land-bound rites, or lessons learned through travel or hardship, you gain +1 bonus die on checks using the chosen skill when lived experience is relevant
Read the Ground Type: Free Action (Pattern Recognition) • Cost: — • Usage: 1/Scene — When entering or crossing a physical environment with coherent terrain or crowd flow, roll Survival or Perception. On a success, you gain +1 bonus die on your next roll this scene made to move through, reposition within, or brace against that environment. This does not detect threats or intentions.
Stand When Others Stagger Type: Reaction (Endurance Check) • Cost: — • Usage: 1/Scene — When you fail a CON or Athletics roll made to resist fatigue, environmental stress, knockdown, or forced repositioning, you may immediately reroll the check and take the second result. This reroll cannot be further modified.
Stonewise Bearing Type: Passive (Environmental Literacy) • Cost: — • Usage: At-will — You treat difficult, unstable, or uneven physical terrain as manageable for the purpose of movement and positioning. You do not suffer penalty dice or additional movement costs from rubble, loose ground, broken infrastructure, or natural hazards when repositioning deliberately. This does not increase speed, negate forced movement, or prevent falls caused by external force.
