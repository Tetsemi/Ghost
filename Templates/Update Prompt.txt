Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Career key: investigator	

Section: Tier 5 Capstone Talents

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMapObject, Career HTML, Tracker HTML

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON).

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Career + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:

Investigator – Tier 5 Capstones (30 XP) — Choose One
Talent	Description	Prerequisite
Absolute Reconstruction	Type: Action • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — After concentrating for one full Round at a location or over a dataset you have examined this Scene, roll Investigation; on a success, ask the GM up to three specific questions about the sequence of the most recent significant event that occurred there within the last hour, with answers limited to what can be inferred from physical, digital, or arcane evidence and without revealing hidden intent. Until the end of the Scene, the first allied Action that directly exploits one of these answers gains +1 bonus die.	Broad-Spectrum Assessment
Temporal Intuition	Type: Action • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Roll Insight. On a success, the GM describes one major event likely to occur within the next hour if no meaningful intervention takes place, framed as a probable outcome rather than a certainty.	Veil Discontinuity Sense
Decisive Leverage	Type: Action • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — During a social confrontation, after succeeding on an opposed social roll against a target you have engaged earlier this Scene, choose up to three allies who can see or hear the exchange. The next opposed social roll made by each chosen ally against that target this Scene gains +1 bonus die. This does not compel behavior or force truthful answers.	Crack the Mask
Operational Override	Type: Reaction • Cost: 1d6 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — When a Scene pivots due to a revealed clue, contradiction, or discovery you directly uncovered this Scene, you may immediately allow yourself and up to two allies within Close range to each take one Maneuver outside the normal turn order. These Maneuvers cannot be used to attack or cast spells and must be resolved immediately or the opportunity is lost.	Anchor the Moment
Cold Case Instinct	Type: Passive • Cost: — • Usage: 1/Session — Once per Session, when a Scene ends without resolving a central question you were actively investigating, you retain one unresolved lead; the next time that lead becomes relevant, gain +1 bonus die on the first Investigation, Insight, or Interrogation check made to pursue it.	Veil Discontinuity Sense
