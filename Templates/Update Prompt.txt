Context: We are migrating to a new source of truth for Career talents. I will upload:

ghost_of_arcadia.html (current sheet)

ghost_of_arcadia.css (current sheet CSS)

translation.json (i18n)

And I will paste the updated text for this career/section.

Task: Update ONLY the following for, do not look ahead at other tiers, only the current one:

Career key: soul_forger	

Section: talents.<talent name>.tier === 4 , capstone: true

What to produce (MUST be separate downloadable files):

HTML patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated HTML), group sections together careerDataMapObject, Career HTML, Tracker HTML

CSS patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated CSS).

JSON patch/snippet for this section only (no unrelated JSON).

Hard rules:

Use the indentation and formatting in existing files

Provide additions and deletions for the section requested only

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

In chat output, include exactly one code block titled “Provenance & Checks” that lists validations and counts (see checklist below).

Alphabetize everything you generate that is map-like or list-like (talent keys, i18n keys, etc.).

Validate skill keys against skillDataMap in ghost_of_arcadia.html and explicitly list any missing/unknown skill keys (do not guess replacements).

Follow existing sheet conventions (naming, class prefixes sheet-, hidden lock/enabled fields, tier layout conventions). Do not invent new structure.

i18n: provide full changes including names and description fields

Career data requirements (new source of truth):

Update/create the career’s data object for this section using i18n keys (e.g., nameKey, rulesKey, etc.) rather than hydrated label attrs.

For talents: include tier, cost, usage_limit, strain, prerequisite expression, and any tracker/icon hooks required by the existing UI patterns.

Section includes: careerDataMap entries, Tier X talent UI rows, and any tracker rows/CSS affected by usage_limit changes.

Provenance & Checks (in the single code block):

Files used: list the 3 uploaded filenames.

Career + section targeted.

Counts: talents updated/added, skills added/changed, i18n keys added/changed.

Validations performed:

JSON validity (parseable)

No duplicate i18n keys created

All referenced skill keys exist in skillDataMap (or list missing)

HTML uses correct data-i18n keys present in the JSON snippet

CSS selectors scope is correct for Roll20 (.ui-dialog .tab-content .charsheet ...)

Tracker hooks updated: any talent with usage_limit scene/session appears in the correct tracker list and not the wrong one.

Hard gates:

Do not output any inline code blocks for HTML/CSS/JSON in chat. Only provide them as downloadable files.

Output patches MUST be ADD / REMOVE blocks only (no +/- diffs).

Tracker coupling is mandatory: any tracker HTML ADD/REMOVE must have matching CSS attr_show_* selector ADD/REMOVE.

Provenance must include Patch Manifest lines for: careerDataMap, Tier rows, Tracker rows, CSS show-selectors, i18n keys, skill-key validation, JSON parse.
If any gate fails, regenerate in the same response.

Corrections:

Pistol is replaced by Handgun
pistol is replaced by handgun
Archanotech is replaced by Arcanotech
archanotech is replaced by arcanotech

Inputs:

Soul Forger – Tier 4 Capstones (40 XP each) — Choose One
Talent	Description	Prerequisite
Bound War-Chassis (Permanent Companion)	Type: Downtime Creation; Passive in Play • Build Cost: 10,000 credits (base frame) — In Downtime, permanently bind a Bound Spirit into a combat chassis built from a suitable salvaged shell. It acts on your Initiative with one Maneuver and one Action per Round. Baseline Statline: HP 10; DR 2 (physical); Evasion 40%; Attack 55%. Choose one role at binding: Skirmisher (melee 1d6+1), Gunner (weapon supplied separately), or Bulwark (allies Engaged gain +1 cover step; melee 1d6). The chassis is always spirit-infused and ignores EMP/Blackout (it instead becomes Impaired until the start of its next turn). You may apply one Tier 2 or Tier 3 Soul Forger buff to it at a time. If reduced to 0 HP, it becomes inert. Emergency Wake (1/Session): At Engaged range, take an Action, pay 1d6 Strain, and roll Arcanotech or Mechanics; on success it rises to 1 HP (Hard+ restores 1d6+1 HP). Full repair requires Downtime. Only one War-Chassis may be active at a time. Each Round, the War-Chassis may take either one Action or one Maneuver. If you forgo your Maneuver on your turn, the War-Chassis may take both one Action and one Maneuver that Round.	Spirit Lattice Field
City-Weave Circuit	Type: Action; Concentration • Cost: 1d6+1 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — You must be Engaged with an access point (console, junction box, relay) tied to a single site-scale security domain within Medium range. Roll Technomancy or Summoning opposed by the site’s Defense Rating. On success, you seize control of the domain for the Scene: site sensors ignore your crew; hostile remote actions suffer 1 penalty die; doors, gates, and elevators respond to your commands; site turrets and drones treat your crew as friendly. Protocol Pulse (Free, 1/Round): Choose one — Lock Cycle (force open or closed one door/gate), Blind Eye (one sensor cluster ignores all targets or only sees hostiles for 1 Round), or Sentry Jinx (one site turret/drone takes –20% until the start of your next turn). You must remain within the site; starting a new Concentration ends this effect. Bound Spirits within the site obey the weave; Greater Spirits are unaffected. Hardened subsystems ignore individual Protocol Pulse effects. Each Protocol Pulse costs 1 Strain.	Helmgeist Protocol
Cathedral of Scrap	Type: Action • Cost: 1d8+2 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — If sufficient debris exists within Short range, fuse multiple Bound Spirits into a single Large colossus at Engaged range for the Scene. Statline: HP 16; DR 3 (physical); Dodge 35%; Smash 65% (1d8+2); Hurl Debris 55% (1d6, Medium range). Traits: Bulwark Mass (allies Engaged gain Partial Cover; ranged attacks against them suffer 1 penalty die), Impact (on a Hard+ Smash, either knock the target back one range band or impose Impaired until the start of its next turn). The colossus acts with one Maneuver and one Action per Round and collapses into inert scrap when the Scene ends or at 0 HP.	Battlefield Reclamation
Nullwave Bloom	Type: Action • Cost: 1d8+2 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — Release a Veil-charged disruption pulse out to Medium range. Unattended devices, drones, and vehicles animated by Bound Spirits are Stunned until the start of your next turn (they lose their Action and Maneuver, but may still take Reactions if applicable), then become Impaired for 1 Round. Attended machines oppose your Technomancy or Summoning with the higher of the operator’s relevant skill or the device’s Defense Rating; on your success, the host machine is Stunned until the start of your next turn, then Impaired for 1 Round; on a success by the defender, it becomes Impaired for 1 Round only. Individuals in range test POW; on a failure, their comms, Smartlink, optics, and HUDs are disabled until the start of their next turn (no Condition applied). Cyberware, life-support systems, and non-smart firearms are unaffected. Greater Spirits and Avatars are unaffected.	Spirit Lattice Field
Circuit Apotheosis	Type: Action; Concentration • Cost: 1d6+2 Strain • Usage: 1/Session — You project your spirit into the ArcNet for the Scene; your body falls prone but remains conscious. Choose an access point within Medium range as your entry node. While apotheosed, treat that node as Engaged for ArcNet actions. With an OmniDeck: gain +10% to all Slicing rolls; when targeted in the ArcNet, you may defend using Slicing instead of the deck’s Defense Rating. Without an OmniDeck: you may perform ArcNet support actions only (scan, assist, stabilize, open/close nodes); you cannot make ArcNet attack actions. Any ArcNet feedback damage you suffer is taken as Strain instead of HP. If this drops you to 0 Strain, the effect ends immediately and you are Impaired on your next turn. If your body takes damage, the effect ends immediately. You may end this effect as a Free Action at the start of your turn. Bound Spirits within the ArcNet may be leveraged; Greater Spirits and Avatars remain beyond your control. This talent does not reduce interaction time, escalation, or System Overrun effects.
