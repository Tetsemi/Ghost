Update Combat section to use new names for Combat skills (Firearms(HG) becomes Pistol)

Update colors

Combat and Spells

Add Magic_Universal for Other 1

Update code to reset calculations when switch races, currently non-active race skill bonuses from background and talents are applying.
Do not regress code so values aren't saved and reapplied for active race.
Possible fix, when switching races, all *_mdr is reset to *_skill_mdr and then bonuses for the active race are applied from backgrounds and talents for that race.

So it would be

reset *_mdr to *_skill_mdr (so you don't overwrite someone adding skill points
apply bonuses based on checkboxes checked for backgrounds and talents for the active race only.
