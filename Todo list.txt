Update colors

Add XP Pool single input box, XP pool available, but put in framework, like skill point above to track XP spent and XP total down the road.
Add/Change XP Total should look at XP Spent value and update XP available (read only).


Add Strain roll to Combat for Spells

Add column for extreme/critical damage.

Bug report

DEX/2 formula is blocking an auto-pop into the VAL column for some reason. The other variables are working, so is it a string v int thing or something more?

Dodge SP columns starts zero, Val doesn't autopop to dex/2, then when you overwite it stays linked to SP




Language (Caltheran) Autopops to EDU in Val, and tells you 'EDU' in SP, then when you overwrite SP, Val auto-calcs to SP + EDU

Charm doesn't autopop the 15 into Val while the other Social Skills seem to, SP and Val both initialize to 0 while for Dance and Bureaucracy, for example, it initializes to 5/5 for SP/Val

Overwriting links SP to Val like the other cases
