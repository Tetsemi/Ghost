	"background_aelvareth_devotee-u": "You were raised in the ceremonial houses of Ael’Vareth — homes of ritual, silence, and sacred continuity. Your early life was shaped by ink-sealed truths and generations of coded reverence.",
	"background_aelvareth_devotee_quote-u": "&ldquo;The path is not easy. But it leads home.&rdquo; — Scribe-Keeper Saelien",
	"background_ash_war_refugee-u": "You came from a place that doesn’t exist anymore. A war zone, collapsed sector, or buried city. You lost things early — family, home, maybe even your name—but you clawed forward anyway. Now you carry that weight like armor, and you never stop moving.",
	"background_ash_war_refugee_quote-u": "&ldquo;Some things can’t be fixed. But they can be outrun.&rdquo; — Nara Dell, trauma medic",
	"background_break_faced_radical-u": "You were raised among the Unmasked — a faction that believes hiding is just another kind of prison. You’ve lived openly before, and you’ve seen the cost. But you’d rather face hatred than erase yourself. Your voice is loud, your mask is thin, and your fire runs deep.",
	"background_break_faced_radical_quote-u": "&ldquo;You say I’m dangerous because I want to be seen. I say you’re dangerous because you don’t.&rdquo; — Myre, Voice of the Fifth Unmasking",
	"background_clawbound_kin_warder-u": "You were trained early to protect what mattered — pack, den, territory. Whether in the Wilds or a hidden creche under New Arcadia's mid-tiers, you stood between your own and danger, claws out, instincts sharp. Now, you carry that discipline with you, even if the pack is gone.",
	"background_clawbound_kin_warder_quote-u": "&ldquo;A promise isn’t words. It’s the scar you carry when they don’t come back.&rdquo; — Mak Vesh, bodyguard to the Emberveil Archive run",
	"background_cliffborn_laborer-u": "You weren’t trained in combat. You were trained in balance, in leverage, in shaping weight into permanence. Whether as a builder, hauler, or structural code-welder, your youth was spent beneath scaffolds or atop sun-baked ridgelines.",
	"background_cliffborn_laborer_quote-u": "&ldquo;The world doesn’t care what you break. It remembers what you build.&rdquo; —Kael Thorne, Archival Mason of Skyreach",
	"background_code_seer_prodigy-u": "You weren’t taught by teachers. You were trained by protocols—fed code like food, stories like systems, and magic like firmware. Whether raised by an AI cult or under the blinking gaze of an abandoned cyber-shrine, your world has always been written in loops, glyphs, and gradients of belief.",
	"background_code_seer_prodigy_quote-u": "&ldquo;The difference between a spell and a script is syntax.&rdquo; —Meiko &ldquo;Mirrordust&rdquo; Shin, Arcanet Devourer",
	"background_contract_born-u": "You were born under signature and seal—whether by pact, blood, or mercenary code. Loyalty wasn’t given. It was negotiated. You learned early that promises are power, and names carry weight when backed by steel or silence. Reputation? You protect it like a second spine.",
	"background_contract_born_quote-u": "&ldquo;Paper burns. A deal doesn’t. Remember that.&rdquo; —Raiku the Gray, Pactbreaker and Broker",
	"background_corpsepath_reclaimer-u": "Necrotech isn’t about reverence. It’s about resource. You were trained to see death as architecture—to rebuild it, animate it, and strip it for parts. Whether you worked in a death clinic, a black-market reprocessing node, or a Huskspire forge, you learned how to make use of what others fear.",
	"background_corpsepath_reclaimer_quote-u": "&ldquo;Most people see a body and flinch. You saw leverage.&rdquo; —Dran Kett, Boneframe Architect",
	"background_cross_signal_raised-u": "You didn’t grow up in a warren. You didn’t learn Chirr at the right frequency. Maybe your parents were wanderers, or maybe you were pulled from the wreckage of some broken transit pod and raised by humans, Feran, or Khadra. You learned early that speech doesn’t always mean what it says—that tone, rhythm, and metaphor are often the true payload.<br> You didn’t abandon your Scav instincts. You just added translation layers. And now you know how to work in a world where nothing means just one thing.",
	"background_cross_signal_raised_quote-u": "&ldquo;They didn’t explain what they meant. They expected me to feel it. So, I learned to fake the feeling—and then I learned to understand it.&rdquo; —Patchlock Jyn, alias translator and empathic debugger",
	"background_data_hatched-u": "You weren’t born in any traditional sense. Whether from a surrogate vat, a legacy AI caretaking cluster, or a sealed knowledge enclave, your early life was filtered through data, structured routines, and synthesized learning. You think in maps, modules, and risk equations—rarely in trust.",
	"background_data_hatched_quote-u": "&ldquo;Born from bandwidth. Raised by protocols.&rdquo; — Syn9, registered dentity cluster",
	"background_dust_seer_novice-u": "You were raised in one of the ancient desert enclaves—where the winds whisper the names of the dead and diviners trace futures in ash and sand. Whether you walked the outer dunes or tended relic-shrines, the Veil was never far from you.",
	"background_dust_seer_novice_quote-u": "&ldquo;The wind may bury names—but not all voices fade.&rdquo; —Kaeli Sunshale, Veilwarden of the Last Outpost",
	"background_echoborne-u": "Descended from a bloodline of Veilwalkers, court mystics, or archivists, your presence carries weight. Whether earned or inherited, you are a reminder of power long woven into lineage.",
	"background_echoborne_quote-u": "&ldquo;You hear echoes of greatness. The question is—will you rise to match them?&rdquo; — High Scribe Relan, House Archivist",
	"background_enclave_born-u": "You were raised behind walls — not always golden, but high enough to keep the world out. Whether it was a corporate childcare ward, an academic arcology, or the glass corridors of a firstborn citizen tier, you learned the value of reputation, compliance, and how to ask for what you want with a smile sharp enough to draw blood.",
	"background_enclave_born_quote-u": "&ldquo;Clean air, clean hands, clean lies.&rdquo; — Riss Vonn, former Corezone candidate",
	"background_forgeblood_scavenger-u": "You grew up among ruin-seekers and junk-scribes — those who see beauty in rust and stories in salvage. You learned the sacred art of patchwork survival, and that even broken things can be sacred.",
	"background_forgeblood_scavenger_quote-u": "&ldquo;Nothing is trash until it’s dead. And even then, ask twice.&rdquo; — Drex Tullar, Tinker-Mystic",
	"background_ghostline_runner-u": "Your first name was sold. Your second was stolen. You grew up embedded in the fringe economy — courier, slicer, infiltrator — trading secrets and masks as currency. You learned to trust code more than people, and vanish when the wrong one came looking.",
	"background_ghostline_runner_quote-u": "&ldquo;Information is just another identity. And I wear both well.&rdquo; — Alias: &lsquo;Glass&rsquo;, Contract Broker ",
	"background_ghostline_whelp-u": "Born in the back lanes of fractured arcologies and the glow of data temples, you grew up between veilshocks and grid storms. You learned to hear both spirit and signal in the quiet—slipping between echoes, ducking ICE traces, reading the weight of silence like a second language.",
	"background_ghostline_whelp_quote-u": "&ldquo;Spirits talk. Firewalls hum. I just listen better than most.&rdquo; —Zero-Tail, Freelance Veilcaster",
	"background_glide_spire_scion-u": "Raised in a cliffside arcology, you moved effortlessly between etiquette and survival. You learned to slip through conversation like a dancer — poised, precise, and prepared for the unexpected",
	"background_glide_spire_scion_quote-u": "&ldquo;Don’t let the silk fool you. I know which fork goes where — and which wrist to cut.&rdquo; —Elara Kade, Cultural Icon",
	"background_gutterfire_youth-u": "You didn’t climb the ladder — you slipped between the rungs. Raised on the fringe or beneath the mid-tier plates, you survived by instinct, bluff, and running fast when things went loud. You learned which lights meant danger, and which shadows meant home.",
	"background_gutterfire_youth_quote-u": "&ldquo;They called it crime. I called it breakfast.&rdquo;— Avi Jex, slicer-for-hire",
	"background_hatchwarren_drifter-u": "You grew up in the crawlspaces between sectors—half-formed infrastructure, half-abandoned dreams. You learned to sleep near heat vents, track signal drops, and scavenge before anyone else even knew the cache existed. You know the sound of a breaker going soft before it burns out. You move like static and strike like a glitch no one patched.",
	"background_hatchwarren_drifter_quote-u": "&ldquo;Doesn’t matter if it’s locked. That just means it still works.&rdquo; —Tavik-7, Crawlway Echo",
	"background_horn_carved_wanderer-u": "You were born beneath endless sky and shifting moons, part of a clan that never settled. Every hill had a name. Every step was history. You learned to track storms, read the stars, and listen for the pulse of the land.",
	"background_horn_carved_wanderer_quote-u": "&ldquo;Our map is memory. Our compass is the wind.&rdquo; —Jaya Senn, Pathkeeper of Clan Varn",
	"background_legacy_bearer-u": "You were chosen to inherit a legacy mask — an identity worn by one who came before. You studied their voice, their movements, their stories. You don’t just wear their face. You carry their memory, and the weight of what it meant to be them",
	"background_legacy_bearer_quote-u": "&ldquo;This face is older than I am. I carry it for someone who can’t anymore.&rdquo; — Toval Arin, Echo-Caller of Greyhold",
	"background_loop_minder_initiate-u": "You were raised inside a Freehand data warren—more server cluster than shelter. You spent your youth tracing signal decay, mapping ghost-pings, and slicing locked nodes with makeshift code. You learned to read people the way you read systems: by where they break first.",
	"background_loop_minder_initiate_quote-u": "&ldquo;The system always leaves a backdoor. You just need to think like it forgot.&rdquo; —Rinza, Pulseflow Slicer",
	"background_oathbreakers_kin-u": "Your family bears a mark—betrayal, failure, exile. You weren’t born into glory, but into expectation: to fix what came before. You learned to fight harder, speak less, and carry your shame without complaint. Redemption isn’t given. It’s carved out.",
	"background_oathbreakers_kin_quote-u": "&ldquo;A name can be redeemed. But only if it’s carried like a blade.&rdquo; —Thava Rimehand, Blacklist Sentinel",
	"background_outpost_raised-u": "You were born far from the towers — in a frontier hold, dustfarm, or fringe commune where the only thing colder than the nights was the silence between screams. You learned to shoot before you learned to barter, and to fix things before asking for help.",
	"background_outpost_raised_quote-u": "&ldquo;Sand. Silence. A shotgun and a solar still. That’s childhood.&rdquo; — Mika Alren, circuit-runner of the Dustline",
	"background_packborn_drifter-u": "You were raised in a roaming pack — scavenging, migrating, watching the land change underfoot. Your world was one of hushed voices, quiet fires, and bond-rituals etched into memory. You learned how to listen first, act second, and vanish third.",
	"background_packborn_drifter_quote-u": "&ldquo;They raised me to run — and to know when to stop.&rdquo; — Shesska Vell, wayfinder of the Low Fracture routes",
	"background_run_shadow_cub-u": "You were raised on the move—between rooftops and dead forests, ledges and lightning rails. Yours was a life of silence, sprint, and edge-balancing. The road made you clever. The wind made you quiet. And you never stayed long enough for your footprints to harden.",
	"background_run_shadow_cub_quote-u": "&ldquo;No tail trails the wind. No eye follows the blur.&rdquo; —Yuna Driftstep, Scout of the Thirteenth Coil",
	"background_scavsteel_whelp-u": "You were born in the shadow of scrap towers and arc-flicker salvage yards, where every broken panel might spark a miracle. Your hands knew rust before soap, and your first tools were stolen, gifted, or bartered in desperation. You see potential in ruin — and utility in everything else.",
	"background_scavsteel_whelp_quote-u": "&ldquo;Hard part isn’t finding the parts. It’s remembering why you needed them in the first place.&rdquo; — Pryce &lsquo;Wirejaw&rsquo; Kethel, deckrunner of Tier 9",
	"background_scorchborn_fugitive-u": "You weren’t just shaped by fire. You ran from it. Your past is a blur of betrayal, smoke, and blood. Maybe your pack was wiped out. Maybe you were exiled. All you know is that you survived — and now you don’t trust anyone until they’ve earned the right to bleed beside you.",
	"background_scorchborn_fugitive_quote-u": "&ldquo;They burned the den. I burned the path behind me.&rdquo; — Raka Thornjaw, rogue Veil scout",
	"background_shatterlink_courier-u": "You carried messages others couldn’t. Through active scan zones, through arcanotech static fields, through Corp zones on full lockdown. Whether by rooftop crawl, hidden liftshaft, or data-shadow encoded into your spinejack, you moved information no one else could touch. You don’t just know the map—you know beneath it.",
	"background_shatterlink_courier_quote-u": "&ldquo;Didn’t ask who it was for. Just asked where the drop went.&rdquo; —&ldquo;Ghosthand&rdquo; Vesh, independent signal runner",
	"background_shrine_den_scion-u": "You were raised beneath carved beams and paper wards, where spirit-whispers slipped between incense and stillness. Whether your clan upheld a sacred pact or simply honored the memory of the old rites, you grew up on the threshold between the Veil and the waking world—feet bare on stone, heart tuned to the pulse of what hides behind the wind.",
	"background_shrine_den_scion_quote-u": "“Some of us were born in silence. The rest of you never learned to hear it.” —Kana Riyo, Night-Seer of the Third Flame",
	"background_soft_year_drifter-u": "You grew up on the edge of cities, in shelters and stolen places, trying on forms like borrowed jackets. You learned early how the world looks at you differently depending on what you wear—and how to use that. You became a chameleon not by choice, but by necessity.",
	"background_soft_year_drifter_quote-u": "&ldquo;I became a dozen people before I ever figured out which one was mine.&rdquo; — Kala Verrin, Maskwright Apprentice ",
	"background_spiritbound_techshaper-u": "Born to walk two worlds — metal and memory — you were marked by innovation and instinct. While others feared your gifts, your clan gave you tools instead of chains. You speak to circuits and spirits alike.",
	"background_spiritbound_techshaper_quote-u": "&ldquo;If a spirit wants a body, I’ll build one. If it wants freedom...that’s harder.&rdquo; —Neshri, RAM-Binder",
	"background_stonehold_disciple-u": "You were raised in the quiet halls of a traditional clan bastion, where each stone bore a name and every sunrise began with stillness. Your life was one of rituals, sparring drills, and the steady hum of ward-chants echoing through reinforced corridors.",
