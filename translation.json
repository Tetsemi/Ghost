Maybe your parents were wanderers, or maybe you were pulled from the wreckage of some broken transit pod and raised by humans, Feran, or Khadra. You learned early that speech doesn’t always mean what it says—that tone, rhythm, and metaphor are often the true payload.<br> You didn’t abandon your Scav instincts. You just added translation layers. And now you know how to work in a world where nothing means just one thing.",

	"background_data_hatched-u": "You weren’t born in any traditional sense.

	"background_ghostline_runner-u": "Your first name was sold. Your second was stolen. You grew up embedded in the fringe economy — courier, slicer, infiltrator — trading secrets and masks as currency. You learned to trust code more than people, and vanish when the wrong one came looking.",

	"background_gutterfire_youth-u": "You didn’t climb the ladder — you slipped between the rungs. Raised on the fringe or beneath the mid-tier plates, you survived by instinct, bluff, and running fast when things went loud. You learned which lights meant danger, and which shadows meant home.",
	"background_gutterfire_youth_quote-u": "&ldquo;They called it crime. I called it breakfast.&rdquo;— Avi Jex, slicer-for-hire",
	"background_hatchwarren_drifter-u": "You grew up in the crawlspaces between sectors—half-formed infrastructure, half-abandoned dreams. You learned to sleep near heat vents, track signal drops, and scavenge before anyone else even knew the cache existed. You know the sound of a breaker going soft before it burns out. You move like static and strike like a glitch no one patched.",

	"background_horn_carved_wanderer-u": "You were born beneath endless sky and shifting moons, part of a clan that never settled. Every hill had a name. Every step was history. You learned to track storms, read the stars, and listen for the pulse of the land.",

	"background_legacy_bearer-u": "You were chosen to inherit a legacy mask — an identity worn by one who came before. You studied their voice, their movements, their stories. You don’t just wear their face. You carry their memory, and the weight of what it meant to be them",
	"background_legacy_bearer_quote-u": "&ldquo;This face is older than I am. I carry it for someone who can’t anymore.&rdquo; — Toval Arin, Echo-Caller of Greyhold",
	"background_loop_minder_initiate-u": "You were raised inside a Freehand data warren—more server cluster than shelter. You spent your youth tracing signal decay, mapping ghost-pings, and slicing locked nodes with makeshift code. You learned to read people the way you read systems: by where they break first.",

	"background_not_active-u": "Background not active",
	"background_oathbreakers_kin-u": "Your family bears a mark—betrayal, failure, exile. You weren’t born into glory, but into expectation: to fix what came before. You learned to fight harder, speak less, and carry your shame without complaint. Redemption isn’t given. It’s carved out.",
	"background_oathbreakers_kin_quote-u": "&ldquo;A name can be redeemed. But only if it’s carried like a blade.&rdquo; —Thava Rimehand, Blacklist Sentinel",
	"background_outpost_raised-u": "You were born far from the towers — in a frontier hold, dustfarm, or fringe commune where the only thing colder than the nights was the silence between screams. You learned to shoot before you learned to barter, and to fix things before asking for help.",

	"background_packborn_drifter-u": "You were raised in a roaming pack — scavenging, migrating, watching the land change underfoot. Your world was one of hushed voices, quiet fires, and bond-rituals etched into memory. You learned how to listen first, act second, and vanish third.",
	"background_packborn_drifter_quote-u": "&ldquo;They raised me to run — and to know when to stop.&rdquo; — Shesska Vell, wayfinder of the Low Fracture routes",
	"background_run_shadow_cub-u": "You were raised on the move—between rooftops and dead forests, ledges and lightning rails. Yours was a life of silence, sprint, and edge-balancing. The road made you clever. The wind made you quiet. And you never stayed long enough for your footprints to harden.",
	"background_run_shadow_cub_quote-u": "&ldquo;No tail trails the wind. No eye follows the blur.&rdquo; —Yuna Driftstep, Scout of the Thirteenth Coil",
	"background_scavsteel_whelp-u": "You were born in the shadow of scrap towers and arc-flicker salvage yards, where every broken panel might spark a miracle. Your hands knew rust before soap, and your first tools were stolen, gifted, or bartered in desperation. You see potential in ruin — and utility in everything else.",
	"background_scavsteel_whelp_quote-u": "&ldquo;Hard part isn’t finding the parts. It’s remembering why you needed them in the first place.&rdquo; — Pryce &lsquo;Wirejaw&rsquo; Kethel, deckrunner of Tier 9",
	"background_scorchborn_fugitive-u": "You weren’t just shaped by fire. You ran from it. Your past is a blur of betrayal, smoke, and blood. Maybe your pack was wiped out. Maybe you were exiled.

	"background_shrine_den_scion-u": "You were raised beneath carved beams and paper wards, where spirit-whispers slipped between incense and stillness. Whether your clan upheld a sacred pact or simply honored the memory of the old rites, you grew up on the threshold between the Veil and the waking world—feet bare on stone, heart tuned to the pulse of what hides behind the wind.",

	"background_soft_year_drifter-u": "You grew up on the edge of cities, in shelters and stolen places, trying on forms like borrowed jackets. You learned early how the world looks at you differently depending on what you wear—and how to use that. You became a chameleon not by choice, but by necessity.",

You immediately suffer 1d4 Strain, and the result of the action is treated as incomplete, risky, or short-lived in a way that follows directly from how you pushed it through.

In scenes where past actions, unresolved consequences, or recognizable behavior patterns matter, the GM may treat you as already known, suspected, or associated with trouble, even if you were not formally identified at the time. This does not grant automatic failure, impose fixed penalties, or override successful disguises or preparations.

Its shifts, fractures, and instabilities register in their bodies long before they become visible or disruptive. Where others experience a Veil event as a sudden intrusion, Lyranni often feel it approaching—like a change in pressure before a storm. How this sensitivity manifests varies from individual to individual. Some experience headaches, vertigo, or nosebleeds. Others feel nausea, heat behind the eyes, trembling hands, emotional unease, or a subtle distortion in perception. A few describe it as an ache in old scars, a ringing in the ears, or the sense that something nearby is out of alignment. Whatever the form, the sensation is unmistakable once learned.\n\nRules:\nWhen the local Veil state is unstable, strained, thinning, or actively changing—such as near rifts, fractures, breaches, ritual disturbances, or heavily Veil-saturated environments—the GM may describe physical or sensory discomfort affecting you. This sensation does not identify the source, location, cause, or intent of the disturbance, and it never provides tactical detail or automatic warning. It exists to signal that the Veil is no longer behaving normally. Veil Sensitivity never causes automatic failure and does not impose fixed mechanical penalties by default. Instead, it creates persistent sensory pressure that may complicate concentration, rest, social composure, or prolonged exposure at the GM’s discretion. Appropriate preparation, distance, shielding, or removal from the affected area can reduce or eliminate these effects. This sensitivity is constant but uneven. Over time, most Lyranni learn to recognize their own tells—but they can never fully ignore them.",
